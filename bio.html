  “lt's akin to the ancient art of Bonsai,” explains Bonn O'Brien between sips of house blend at a

  Brooklyn coffee shop. '‘It takes patience. It takes an eye for detail. It's reverence, respect, and a
  steady hand all rolled into one. It's the only way to take care ofa proper beard. We take the
  same approach to our music.“

  Three years ago, the O'Brien—|ead The Dapper Beards burst into the countrys collective
  consciousness like a Salvador Dali ‘stache thanks to their now—iconic appearance on the cover
  ofthe trendy periodical "Garden and Gun.” "The Beards Are Here, And They Will Save Folk
  Music” read the headline. The striking image ofthe four bandmates in repose, silhouetted by a
  SoHo sunset was an immediate viral sensation.

  "We sued,” says O'Brien with a twist of his mustache, "that's how it went viral. I don't think
  anyone had seen a bold move like that- a band, suing to protect their image after signing off on
  the cover. We owe a big thanks to The Smoking Gun for making that happen. We had approved
  the cover, but we hadn't approved of the people who were going to be reading the magazine.
  Turns out they didn't approach that story with the kind of reverence with which we treat our
  beards- the same approach we take to our music- and we didn't appreciate that."

  And the Folk pigeonhole? O'Brien didn't take kindly to that, either.

  "They never took the time to ask for the spelling. It may sound like the word that is commonly
  used to describe some kinds of roots music, but it wasn't the word that we were using. It's not
  even the music we're doing. Folk- and that's the only time I'm going to use that word- is so
  over. We're Fauxlk. Pronounced the same way as Folk- which, really, is the last time I'm going to
  use that word- but it's spelled F—a-u—x-l—k. lfyou're not going to ask us about our music, which
  we take great care in- similar to the way in which we care for our beards- how can we expect
  you to represent our movement in its proper context to your readers?"

  The ever—serious O'Brien and his band cared not for the lucky break— a musical outfit landing a
  cover on one ofAmerica's more respected musical magazines before ever releasing an album
  or staging a public performance- ifthat break wasn't going to come on their own terms.

  “We take great care in our music, which is also the way we— right, you said it— and we'll be
  damned ifwe're going to let some media machine run roughshod over us."

  With the lawsuit now fully behind them (it was thrown out ofthe only court that would hear the
  groundbreaking piece of litigation— a television courtroom show that is, as its producers kindly
  reminded us, indeed legally binding within thejudicial system), The Dapper Beards are now
  looking towards the future.

  “We're the foremost representatives of Fauxlk music... the face and beards ofthe movement, if
  you will. We take that responsibility very seriously, which is the same way in, well, yeah. So,
  yeah, we're serious"

  And when will the world get to experience this movement firsthand?

  "Soon," says O'Brien. "We're thinking about writing our first song, and maybe even playing it at
  an open mic really soon. But it's not going to be one ofthose slapped—together open mic's,
  mind you. It's going to be a really serious one."
